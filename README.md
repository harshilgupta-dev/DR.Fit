DR.FIT is a mobile application that helps users to plan exercise according to days,
chat with the instructor, and also they can buy fitness products according to their
needs. We will also be adding yoga and meditation features by which users can
plan their meditation and yoga according to desired days. Exercises, yoga, and
meditation are well planned in this application. It goes from beginner to advanced
levels and the user will not feel this transition gap and can do it smoothly.

know how much he/she has to lose or gain weight according to his/her personality.
